# Tigermisu's Crunchlabs HackPack Hacks
Just my personal collection of hacks I've done on the CrunchLabs HackPack box.

## Label Maker
### Upgraded typing UX
- Up/Down only moves one character at a time now, increasing precision.
- Long hold (~800ms) to start fast scrolling.
- Loop to last character if you press up at the start.
- Left/Right do not trigger anymore if Up/Down triggers (prevents accidental deletes or spaces while scrolling).

### Double line printing
- Decreased default scale to print on half of the vanilla painter's tape.
- New character introduced (~, looks like a right arrow on the LCD screen) to break line while editing, allowing you to type a second word in the screen.
- If enabled, prints on both lines, the top one on the top half, the bottom one on the bottom half.
